## Campus Heat Map using Mbed Boards and Beacons

## Summary
A campus app and an administrative dash board with the purpose of creating a dynamic, real-time heat map showing 
where student crowds are on a campus environment at any time. Beacons are deployed around building and in gathering areas to serve as a 
physical web that initiates the reporting of presence in a given area. 
A minimal mobile Android App is developed to perform as a service receiver of beacons, which on receipt, reports to a node server. 
The server keeps track of present users via reports from their cell phones, and also from other sensors in the built environment, 
for instance capacity counters. Mbed boards are used to simulate the sensing of a user by means of a capacity counter installed at classroom entrances. 
Simulation was done using push buttons. Every push is also reported to the same node server which adds up the number of users present in a given area. 
When this number exceeds a threshold, the node server will communicate with the mbed board to turn on its LED light.
